# Quickstart

Get BetweenRows running, connect an upstream PostgreSQL, create a user with a tenant attribute, write a row filter policy, and verify it works through psql and the audit log. Each step links to a detailed guide if you want the full picture.

::: tip Prerequisites
You need Docker and access to a PostgreSQL database (local or remote). If you don't have one handy, the [demo stack](/reference/demo-schema#setup) brings up both BetweenRows and a pre-seeded PostgreSQL in one command.
:::

## 1. Start BetweenRows

```sh
docker run -d --name betweenrows \
  -e BR_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme \
  -p 5434:5434 -p 5435:5435 \
  -v betweenrows_data:/data \
  ghcr.io/getbetweenrows/betweenrows:{{VERSION}}
```

Port 5434 is the SQL proxy (where your users connect). Port 5435 is the admin UI and REST API. The `-v` flag persists the admin database and encryption keys — do not omit it.

→ Full options: [Docker installation guide](/installation/docker)

## 2. Sign in to the admin UI

Open [http://localhost:5435](http://localhost:5435) and log in as `admin` / `changeme`.

::: tip
Pin your Docker tag to a specific version (`:{{VERSION}}`, not `:latest`). Breaking changes between minor versions are called out in the [changelog](https://github.com/getbetweenrows/betweenrows/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
:::

## 3. Add a data source

Go to **Data Sources → Create**. Enter your PostgreSQL connection details (host, port, database, username, password), select an SSL mode, and click **Test Connection**. Once the test passes, save.

→ Full options: [Data Sources guide](/guides/data-sources) — covers every field, access modes, credentials handling, and multi-datasource patterns.

## 4. Discover the catalog

On your new data source, click **Discover Catalog**. Select which schemas, tables, and columns to expose through the proxy. Anything you don't select is invisible to users — BetweenRows defaults to an allowlist model.

→ Full options: [Data Sources guide → Catalog discovery](/guides/data-sources#catalog-discovery)

## 5. Create a user and a tenant attribute

1. Go to **Attribute Definitions → Create**. Define a `tenant` attribute with value type `string` and allowed values `acme`, `globex`, `stark` (or whatever your tenants are).

2. Go to **Users → Create**. Create a user named `alice` with a password. Edit alice and set her `tenant` attribute to `acme`.

3. On the data source page, grant `alice` access by adding her in the **User Access** section.

::: info Admin ≠ data access
Being an admin does **not** grant data plane access. Every user starts with zero data access and must be explicitly granted access to each data source.

## 6. Write a row filter policy

Go to **Policies → Create**. Set:

- **Name:** `tenant-isolation`
- **Type:** `row_filter`
- **Targets:** schemas `*`, tables `*`
- **Filter expression:** `org = {user.tenant}`

Save the policy. Then assign it to your data source with scope **All users**.

This single policy ensures every user sees only the rows where `org` matches their `tenant` attribute.

::: tip Wondering why policies compose this way?
See the [Policy Model](/concepts/policy-model) for the philosophy — zero-trust defaults, deny-wins, and visibility-follows-access.
:::

## 7. Connect with psql and inspect the audit log

Connect through the proxy using the data source name as the database name:

```sh
psql "postgresql://alice:YourPassword@127.0.0.1:5434/your-datasource"
```

Run a query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT org FROM orders;
```

Alice should see only `acme` rows. Create a second user with a different `tenant` attribute (e.g. `bob` → `globex`) and verify they see different rows.

Then open **Query Audit** in the admin UI to see what happened: the original SQL, the rewritten SQL (with the injected `WHERE org = 'acme'`), and which policies were applied.
